predict finishing order and time to cross finish line (lap time)
-- at beginning of given lap, predict time to finish lap
predict gap to leader for all drivers and end of next lap -> extrapolate to last lap for final order

simpelest model that works
- train, test, validation
build framework for different models

start with 1 output linear regression keras model

time series forecasting - look at previous number of laps

train test valid - 3 years for train, 1 year test, 1 year vaild

rmse for time, look at ranking for matchup, area under roc curve using matrix comparisons

get 20 laps as input -> guess next lap time

naive way - predict next lap time as the current lap and plot difference
next week: visualize basic naive model


** ff1.utils.delta_time() over all laps
    - for single driveer:
        - start at lap 2: use previous lap as reference, current lap as compare
        - sum distance over entire race
    - for two drivers:
        - start at lap 1: use driver1 as reference, driver2 as comparison
        - sum distance over entire race


graph: time vs distance

speed = d/t -> speed * dt -> distance -> sum

  ** time on x axis and distance on y axis
    - neural network to predict next lap distances for future

next: plot all drivers for entire race
- use leader distance to calculate differences to every driver and use as y axis

-- exclude first lap? --

*** need to interpolate distances using smallest time intervals ***

scale distances to known lap distance
